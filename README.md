#The console App can be run 
##there is an error at the time to show the balance customers

#the Web App is not currently working
##it is still in process
because I used the .net 8 framework and there were some NuGets that i was using in .net 7 framework, and they were not implemented in this realease yet.

I wanted to use .net 7 framework as everybody on my laptop which 0S is Linux and used Rider to do the projects.
for some reason when i want to download the .net 7 framework, Rider does not find it. 
###What I did
I added 
the controllers (Customer, Employee, Transaction and Home by default)
Data (It was created to manage the data content, but not finsihed)
Extensions ( to help manage the data)
Interfaces(CurrentUserService, CustomerService, EmployeeService, TransactionService)
Models( abstract classes such as Account and User, CurrentAccount, SavingAccount, etc)
Services (CurrentUserService, CustomerService, EmployeeService, TransactionService)
Views (Customer, Employee, Home, Transaction, etc)
Conclusion, it is still in development.
